# Lung Cancer Prediction using CNN and Transfer Learning

This project aims to build a Lung Cancer Prediction System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning. The model classifies lung cancer images into four categories: Normal, Adenocarcinoma, Large Cell Carcinoma, and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
